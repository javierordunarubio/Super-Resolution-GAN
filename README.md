# Super-Resolution-GAN

**Programming language used: Python**
**Language used: english**

In this repo we have built a SR GAN (Super Resolution GAN). The main objective of this GAN is generating a high resolution from a low resolution image. As it's explained in the notebook, we have used two different loss functions for the generator in order to test which one works better, while the loss function for the discriminator is always the same (Binary Cross Entropy).
